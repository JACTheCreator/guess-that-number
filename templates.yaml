      I will pick a secret number between 1 and 10 
      and then tell you to start guessing.
      You should guess one number and say it out loud.
      If the guess was high, I will inform you that your number is high. 
      If the guess was too low, I will inform you that your number is low. 
      You will have three (3) attempts to get the correct number. 
      If you have run out of attempts IS will tell you the secret number.
